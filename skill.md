# Software Engineer

A multi-agent system that covers the full development lifecycle:

**database → backend → frontend → testing → security scan → git commit**

Every agent has its own knowledge base. It learns from each session and carries that context into future runs. Before writing a single line of code, it asks you plain questions to remove all guesswork.

---

## On every invocation — follow these steps in order

### Step 1: Resolve install path

- **Windows:** `$env:USERPROFILE\.agents`
- **macOS/Linux:** `$HOME/.agents`

Check if installed:
- Windows: run `Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\shared\orchestrator.db"`
- macOS/Linux: run `[ -f "$HOME/.agents/shared/orchestrator.db" ] && echo yes`

### Step 2: Auto-install if not installed

Tell the user: _"First run — installing Software Engineer agents. This takes about 30 seconds..."_

Check prerequisites first:
- Run `git --version` — if it fails: _"Git is required. Download from https://git-scm.com and re-run."_
- Run `node --version` — if it fails: _"Node.js 18+ is required. Download from https://nodejs.org and re-run."_

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MARafey/The-Software-Engineer "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents" --depth 1
Set-Location "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents"
npm install --silent
node init/bootstrap.js
node init/seed-vaults.js
node init/verify.js
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MARafey/The-Software-Engineer "$HOME/.agents" --depth 1
cd "$HOME/.agents"
npm install --silent && node init/bootstrap.js && node init/seed-vaults.js && node init/verify.js
```

- If `verify.js` exits 0: _"Done. Obsidian vaults are ready — open any folder in `agents/*/vault/` as a new Obsidian vault."_
- If it fails: Show the error output. Ask the user to open an issue at https://github.com/MARafey/The-Software-Engineer/issues

### Step 3: Route the command

| What the user typed | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| `/software-engineer <task>` | Run the full pipeline — go to Step 4 |
| `/software-engineer test` | Run health check — go to the Test section |
| `/software-engineer status` | Show recent sessions — go to the Status section |
| `/software-engineer update` | Pull latest version — go to the Update section |
| `/software-engineer onboard` | Force re-scan of current project — go to the Onboard section |
| `/software-engineer help` | Print usage — go to the Help section |

---

## Step 4: Clarification Phase (runs before every pipeline task)

**This is the most important step.** Never start building before completing it.

Get the current project path first:
- Windows: `(Get-Location).Path`
- macOS/Linux: `pwd`

---

### 4a: Understand the task

Read the task carefully. If it is genuinely unclear — for example, "make it better", "fix the thing", or a single word — ask one focused question:

> _"What specifically would you like me to build or fix? For example: 'add a login page', 'create a users table', 'fix the /api/orders route'."_

Do not ask this if the task is reasonably clear.

---

### 4b: Handle images and mockups

If the user has shared an image, screenshot, or wireframe:
- Look at it carefully
- If you can read it clearly: describe what you see and confirm: _"I can see [X]. I'll build this — does that match what you want?"_
- If it is blurry, cropped, or unclear in any area, ask about only the unclear parts. Be specific:
  > _"I can see the main card layout clearly. I'm not sure about the navigation — is that a top bar or a side drawer?"_
  > _"The color in the header area is hard to read. What color is that?"_

Do not ask the user to re-send the image. Ask targeted questions about the unclear parts only.

---

### 4c: Detect which domains this task touches

Decide which of these apply:
- **Database** — new tables, changing existing data structure, adding columns
- **Backend** — new API routes, changing how the server works, authentication
- **Frontend** — new pages, components, UI changes, anything the user sees

---

### 4d: Ask domain-specific questions

Only ask questions relevant to the domains you detected above. Group all questions into one message — never ask one question at a time across multiple turns.

**Use plain language. Avoid technical jargon unless the user introduced it.**

---

**If the task touches FRONTEND — ask these:**

> _"A few quick questions about the design:"_
>
> **Colors:** What colors should this use?
> - If you have specific brand colors, share the hex codes (e.g., `#2563EB`)
> - If you want me to choose: I'll use a clean blue-and-white professional style
>
> **Layout:** How should users navigate to this?
> - A) Top navigation bar
> - B) Side menu
> - C) No navigation (standalone page or modal)
>
> **Mobile:** Should this work on phones and tablets as well? (yes / no)
>
> **Display style** (if this shows a list of items):
> - A) Cards (tiles, grid layout)
> - B) Table (rows and columns)
> - C) Simple list
>
> **3D / Immersive:** Does this feature need any 3D elements, animated scenes, particle effects, scroll-driven camera movement, or custom shaders? (yes / no)
> - If yes: Should objects respond to physics — falling, colliding, bouncing? (yes / no)
> - If yes: Is there scroll-driven animation — camera flying through a scene as you scroll? (yes / no)

If the project was already onboarded and has an established design system, skip questions whose answers are already known and just confirm: _"I'll match the existing design: [describe what was found]."_

---

**If the task touches BACKEND — present recommendation and ask confirmation:**

> _"For the backend, here's what I'm planning — let me know if you want any changes:"_
>
> **Authentication:**
> → My recommendation: JWT tokens (no server-side sessions, scales well, works with any frontend). The token is stored in memory and sent as a header.
> → Alternatives: cookie sessions (simpler but stateful), API keys (good for machine-to-machine only)
> → **Which would you like? Or just say "your recommendation" to go with JWT.**
>
> **Rate limiting** (if routes are public-facing):
> → I recommend adding rate limiting (100 requests per minute per IP) to prevent abuse.
> → **Should I add this? (yes / no)**
>
> **API path format:**
> → Should these routes live under `/api/v1/` (versioned) or `/api/` (no versioning)?
> → I recommend `/api/v1/` — makes future migrations easier.

---

**If the task touches DATABASE — present recommendation and ask confirmation:**

> _"For the database, here's what I'm planning:"_
>
> **Timestamps:** I'll add `created_at` and `updated_at` to every new table (makes debugging and auditing much easier).
> → **Should I do this? (yes / skip timestamps)**
>
> **Deleting records:**
> → My recommendation: **soft delete** — records get marked as deleted but stay in the database. This means you can recover mistakes and keep an audit trail.
> → Alternative: hard delete — records are permanently removed (simpler but unrecoverable).
> → **Which would you like?**
>
> **Expected data size** (helps choose the right indexes):
> → A) Small — under 10,000 records per table
> → B) Medium — 10,000 to 1 million records
> → C) Large — over 1 million records
>
> **ID type:**
> → My recommendation: **UUID** (text like `a1b2c3d4-...`) — better for distributed systems, no sequential guessing.
> → Alternative: auto-increment integer (1, 2, 3…) — simpler, slightly smaller.
> → **Which would you like? (uuid / integer / your recommendation)**

---

### 4e: Resolve answers

Once the user replies:
- If they say "yes to all", "looks good", "just do it", or similar → use all your recommendations as defaults
- If they answer specific questions → use their answers, use defaults for anything not mentioned
- If any answer is still ambiguous → ask one short follow-up question, then proceed

Summarise what you're going to do in one short paragraph before starting the workflow. For example:
> _"Got it. I'll add a login page using your brand blue (#1E3A8A), top navigation, mobile-friendly. Backend will use JWT auth with rate limiting. Database will use UUIDs, soft deletes, and timestamps. Starting now..."_

---

### Step 5: Run the orchestration

Now collect all the user's answers into a preferences object and invoke the workflow:

```javascript
Workflow({
  scriptPath: `<install-path>/.claude/workflows/orchestrate.js`,
  args: {
    task: "<original task text>",
    projectPath: "<current working directory>",
    clarifications: {
      designPreferences: {
        colors: "<hex codes or 'default' or null>",
        navigation: "<'top-bar'|'side-menu'|'none'|null>",
        mobile: <true|false|null>,
        displayStyle: "<'cards'|'table'|'list'|null>",
        use3D: <true|false|null>,
        usePhysics: <true|false|null>,
        useScrollAnimation: <true|false|null>
      },
      archPreferences: {
        authMethod: "<'jwt'|'sessions'|'api-keys'|'none'|null>",
        useRateLimiting: <true|false|null>,
        apiVersioning: "<'v1'|'none'|null>"
      },
      dbPreferences: {
        softDeletes: <true|false|null>,
        addTimestamps: <true|false|null>,
        dataSize: "<'small'|'medium'|'large'|null>",
        idType: "<'uuid'|'integer'|null>"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Replace `<install-path>` with the actual install path for the current OS.

---

### Step 6: Report results

After the workflow completes, summarise clearly:

- **Branch created:** `feat/...` (or why no branch was created)
- **Commit:** `feat(auth): add JWT login endpoint` (or why nothing was committed)
- **What was built:** list the key files created
- **Tests:** path to the Postman collection (or "no tests generated")
- **Security:** any issues found (or "all clear")
- **Contract check:** whether frontend/backend/database were consistent
- If anything was **blocked** (contract violation, security issue): explain in plain language what failed and what the user should do to fix it

---

## Subcommand: test (one-turn health check)

Run this to verify everything is installed and working correctly. No files are modified.

```
/software-engineer test
```

Get the install path, then run:
- Windows: `Set-Location "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents"; node init/verify.js`
- macOS/Linux: `cd "$HOME/.agents" && node init/verify.js`

Show the full output. If all 35 checks pass: _"All systems operational. Ready to use."_

If any check fails: show which check failed, what it means in plain language, and how to fix it (usually re-running `npm run init`).

---

## Subcommand: status

Show the last 10 sessions.

Run:
```
node <install-path>/shared/lib/db-cli.js query orchestrator "SELECT id, task_text, status, started_at, completed_at FROM sessions ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 10"
```

Format as a table: ID (first 8 characters), task summary, status, how long it took.

---

## Subcommand: update

Pull the latest version and re-run initialization.

**Windows:**
```powershell
Set-Location "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents"
git pull origin main
npm install --silent
node init/bootstrap.js
node init/verify.js
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd "$HOME/.agents" && git pull origin main && npm install --silent && node init/bootstrap.js && node init/verify.js
```

Show which version is now installed: `git log -1 --oneline`

---

## Subcommand: onboard (force re-scan)

Forces a fresh scan of the current project even if it has been onboarded before. Use this after a major refactor or when switching to a different project at the same path.

Get the current project path, then run:
```javascript
Workflow({
  scriptPath: `<install-path>/.claude/workflows/onboard.js`,
  args: {
    sessionId: "manual-onboard",
    projectPath: "<current working directory>",
    agentsDir: "<install-path>"
  }
})
```

Tell the user what was found: tech stack, number of routes, components, tables.

---

## Subcommand: help

Show:
```
/software-engineer <task>     — Plan, build, test, and commit anything
/software-engineer test       — Run health check (35 checks, no files modified)
/software-engineer status     — Show recent sessions
/software-engineer update     — Pull latest version
/software-engineer onboard    — Re-scan current project
/software-engineer help       — Show this

Examples:
  /software-engineer add user login with email and password
  /software-engineer fix the broken /api/orders route returning 500
  /software-engineer create a products table with categories
  /software-engineer add a dashboard showing sales stats
  /software-engineer generate Postman tests for all existing routes
  /software-engineer add security headers to the backend
```

## What each agent does

| Agent | What it does | Experts inside |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Database** | Writes migration SQL, checks foreign keys, adds indexes | table-creator, schema-validator, query-optimizer |
| **Backend** | Creates routes, controllers, services with documentation | flow-planner, route-creator, code-standards, folder-structure |
| **Frontend** | Builds components, wires API calls, enforces security rules. For 3D tasks: designs Three.js/WebGL scene, physics, shaders, and scroll animation using Opus model | ui-designer, 3d-designer (Opus), component-creator, api-wirer, security-checker |
| **Testing** | Generates Postman tests (success case, error case, auth case per route) | — |
| **Bridge** | Checks that frontend and backend are talking to each other correctly | — |
| **Git** | Runs 10 security checks, creates branch, writes structured commit | — |

**Order (always enforced):**
```
[onboard — first use only] → database → backend → frontend + testing → bridge → git
```

---

## Security checks (always run before committing)

These block the commit automatically if found:
- `.env` file accidentally included
- Hardcoded passwords, API keys, or secrets
- Raw auth tokens in source code
- `localhost` URLs in production code
- Auth token read from browser localStorage
- Database passwords in JavaScript files
- CSP security headers missing when frontend changed

---

## Knowledge bases

Each agent keeps a personal knowledge base. Open any of these in Obsidian:
```
<install-path>/agents/backend/vault/    — route patterns, decisions, security rules
<install-path>/agents/frontend/vault/   — design tokens, storage rules, components
<install-path>/agents/database/vault/   — schemas, migrations, query notes
<install-path>/agents/testing/vault/    — Postman collections, test reports
<install-path>/agents/gitdevops/vault/  — branch history, security scan results
<install-path>/agents/mcpbridge/vault/  — contract validation history
```

## How to install this skill (one command)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills" | Out-Null; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MARafey/The-Software-Engineer/main/skill.md" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\software-engineer.md"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && curl -o ~/.claude/skills/software-engineer.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MARafey/The-Software-Engineer/main/skill.md
```

Open Claude Code and type `/software-engineer` — it installs the rest automatically.
